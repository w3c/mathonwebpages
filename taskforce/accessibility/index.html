title: W3C Math-on-Web Accessibility Task Force
---

<h2>Accessibility Task Force</h2>
<p>The Accessibility Task Force focuses on universal rendering of mathematical content on the web.</p>
<h3>Current work</h3>
<p>
    The Taks force currently works on three aspects of accessibility.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Identifying and documenting best practices</dt>
    <dd>
        By identifying existing tools and documenting the state of assistive technology as it pertains to math rendering on the web, the Task Force aims to enable practitioners to provide best-in-class math rendering.
    </dd>
    <dt>Investigating new directions for accessible rendering</dt>
    <dd>
        By developing prototypes, the Task Force aims to identify potential improvements to existing tools and processes for producing accessible math rendering.
    </dd>
    <dt>Recommendations for web standards</dt>
    <dd>
        Based on its work, the Task Force aims to recommend improvements to web standards such as WAI-ARIA.
